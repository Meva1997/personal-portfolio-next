## About Me

Hi! My name is **Alejandro Medina**. I'm a passionate frontend developer from Mexico (also a U.S. citizen), specializing in building interactive, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology and thrive in dynamic, fast-moving teams.

My journey into tech began thanks to a close friend, and since then, I've been driven by the thrill of solving complex challenges and building products that make a real impact. I'm persistent, curious, and communicate clearly—sometimes I get so involved in projects that I lose track of time! I love learning new technologies and pushing my skills further.

### Fun Fact

Before switching careers, I studied medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara. This experience taught me discipline, attention to detail, and commitment to continuous learning—all traits that enrich my work as a developer.
