        I&apos;m a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-orange-400">
          28-year-old Developer
        </span>
        , born in Mexico and also a
        <span className="font-medium text-orange-400"> U.S. citizen</span> —
        which gives me the flexibility to work{" "}
        <span className="italic">
          remotely or on-site with international teams

        .

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        My journey into programming began thanks to a close friend who opened my
        eyes to the world of tech. Since then, I&apos;ve embraced the thrill of{" "}
        <span className="text-orange-400">solving complex challenges</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-orange-400">
          building products that have a real impact
        </span>
        . I&apos;m especially drawn to working with{" "}
        <span className="italic">startups or fast-moving teams</span> where I
        can <span className="font-medium">grow, adapt, and add value</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        I enjoy both collaborative and independent work. I&apos;m known for
        being{" "}
        <span className="italic">
          persistent, curious, and clear in my communication
        </span>
        . When I get deeply involved in a project, I often lose track of time —
        sometimes even{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-orange-400">
          skipping meals until the issue is solved
        </span>
        ! I&apos;m always eager to learn{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">new technologies</span> and push my skills
        further.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Outside of coding, I&apos;m passionate about{" "}
        <span className="italic">video games</span>,{" "}
        <span className="italic">collecting Pokémon cards</span>,{" "}
        <span className="italic">watching Formula 1</span>,{" "}

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        <span className="italic text-orange-400">Fun fact:</span> Before

          medicine at the Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara

        . It might sound like an unusual path, but it taught me to{" "}
